[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/JosiahOne/cuptane/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/JosiahOne/cuptane/tree/master)

Status: Currently an active WIP. Does not make any security or correctness guarentees.

TUF Dependency: For now we rely on a Rust implementation of TUF here: https://github.com/heartsucker/rust-tuf. This will eventually change.
